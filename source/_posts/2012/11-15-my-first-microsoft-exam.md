Today, I took my first Microsoft exam ever. My exam topics were HTML5, JavaScript and CSS3 ([exam 70-480](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/exam.aspx?id=70-480 "Programming in HTML5 with JavaScript and CSS3")).

My prior knowledge was basic HTML knowledge and I had had a web application project in the near past which covered some client-side stuff using jQuery. [My learning material](https://www.microsoftvirtualacademy.com/tracks/developing-html5-apps-jump-start?WT.mc_id=MSLS_HTML5OfferMVA "Developing in HTML5 with JavaScript and CSS3 Jump Start") consisted of recorded video material by two microsoft guys with mixed-in questions. The exam is currently free of charge using the [coupon code on this page](http://borntolearn.mslearn.net/btl/b/veronica/archive/2012/10/31/html5-free-training-exam-voucher-and-more.aspx "HTML5: Free training, exam voucher and more!").

The part were I was struggling the most were about the usage of the XmlHTTPRequest object, JavaScript inheritence and all the different option on $.ajax(...). Some (educated) guessing was involved on my side ;-)

I got 840 out of 1000 possibleÂ points and passed the exam! Yeah!
