I was struggling how to[ start a second instance of a program](https://fabse.net/blog/2012/11/12/windows-8-how-to-start-a-second-instance-of-a-program/ "Windows 8: How to start a second instance of a program") lately. My best shot in my last article was to shift+click in the start menu.

But it can be soooo easy!

...

Wait for it!

...

**Just shift+click the already open program on the task bar. **

I just had to watch [Scott Hanselman doing demos on ASP.net](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2012/3-028 "Bleeding edge ASP.NET: See what is next for MVC, Web API, SignalR and more…")!
