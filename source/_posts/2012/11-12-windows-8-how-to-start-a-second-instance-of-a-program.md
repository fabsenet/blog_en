Finally I finished switching all my machines to Windows 8\. Using Windows 8 in my day-to-day business, I noticed, it is hard to open a program like Visual Studio a second time. If you open the start menu and click on the icon, Windows will just bring the already open instance in the foreground.

To open a new instance of the program you have to select it using the right mouse button or swiping down with your finger on the icon. The lower app bar appears and you select "open new window" ("Neues Fenster Ã¶ffnen").

Or even easier: **Hold shift while clicking the item!**
