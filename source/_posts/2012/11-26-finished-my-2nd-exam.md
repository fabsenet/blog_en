Last Friday, I finished my second exam successfully! It was [exam 70-486 "Developing ASP.NET MVC 4.5 Web Applications"](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/Exam.aspx?ID=70-486).

The best "meta"-resource for my learning was [a blog entry by Chris](http://www.bloggedbychris.com/2012/11/06/microsoft-exam-70-486-study-guide/) summarizing all knowledge needed combined with links where to get it from.
