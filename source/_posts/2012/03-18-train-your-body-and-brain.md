I am lately into a serious body-shaping program. I started to do more fitness and changing my eating habits. It is working out quite nice for the last months. I am staying 2 or 3 evenings at the fitness center&#160; for two or more hours every week. This is very much time! It bores me driving the bike for up to 60 minutes.

I started to manually download interesting video content with my pc and sync it to the phone. I started with a [fun talk](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/DeveloperStandUpComedyCoding4Fun.aspx) from Scott Hanselman. But the preparation needs to be done in advance and it is taxing to do this manually all the time.

I decided to subscribe for some video podcasts within my favourite web app [Google Reader](http://www.google.de/reader). While there exists an app for it on the phone, it is not really funny for videos because it does not download them in advance. My mobile data plan is to small and the network is not fast enough for video streaming. BeyondPod Podcast Manager solves this task nicely. I told it to update the subscribed feeds every evening when I am at home on WIFI only. Nice!

So far I subscribed to:

*   [This Week On Channel 9](http://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/This+Week+On+Channel+9)*   [Cloud Cover on Channel 9](http://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Cloud+Cover)*   Day[9] ([web](http://day9.tv/), [feed](http://blip.tv/day9tv/rss))  

I am going to need a larger SD Card in the future becaus of all the video content, but this is okay.

Viewing videos on a small sceen is less painful than I thought. If the video is displaying source code or the visual studio IDE, it is zoomed in anyway most of the time. And if there is a Starcraft game in the video, I am well aware of all units and I am able to distinguesh them using only some pixels ![Winking smile](https://az275061.vo.msecnd.net/blogmedia/2012/03/wlEmoticon-winkingsmile5.png)
