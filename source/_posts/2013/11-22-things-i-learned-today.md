I decided to just write down the stuff, I learned today in a random order, to let you know and (maybe) let you learn as well!

*   I really like the whisper sync inside the kindle apps and devices and today I learned about [Calibre](http://calibre-ebook.com/) which can do the same thing but with many more devices. It can also convert your ebooks to the appropriate formats.
*   Even if your company uses Subversion for version control, you can still use git locally in a fully [Git and Other Systems - Git and Subversion](http://git-scm.com/book/ch8-1.html).
*   Does the new XBOX One plays XBOX 360 games? [No](http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-9020_7-57585541-222/xbox-360-games-wont-work-with-the-xbox-one/).
