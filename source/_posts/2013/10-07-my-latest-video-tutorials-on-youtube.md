I decided to try to make some video tutorials about software stuff and I created the first three ones already! Apperently, I decided to do them in German, so you may have a hard time to follow them, if you cannot understand German.

All videos have hand-written closed captions and the last one also has hand-translated englisch captions.

As I disabled comments on this blog, I kindly ask you to tell me, what you think either via email (see Impressums page) or via youtube comments.

It is fun watching myself to grow my presentation skills with every video ![Smiley](https://az275061.vo.msecnd.net/blogmedia/2013/10/wlEmoticon-smile.png)
