I published an article! Cool, isn’t it? You can find it in [web&amp;mobile developer issue 01/14](http://www.webundmobile.de/Aktuelles-Heft/Inhalt-web-mobile-developer-1-2014-10219.html) (german). It was an interesting experience writing this article as I was writing about a subject which I am interested in myself for quite some time.

I am describing a way to collect telemetry data from a Windows Phone application and sending them back to a backend service. I am focusing my article around doing this in a decoupled fashion through the usage of Windows Azure ServiceBus Queues. The goal is to get some data to get insights in the way the users use an app like “How long do they run the app?”, “How often do they start the app?” or “Did they used feature x?”.
