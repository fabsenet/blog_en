I read much. I read so much, I have no time to actually finish any book. I analyzed the pile of books next to my bed and noticed a dozen books! I managed to read all of them until the Â half or so.

[![Under the Hood of dotNet Memory Management](https://az275061.vo.msecnd.net/blogmedia/2012/11/Under-the-Hood-of-dotNet-Memory-Management.jpg "Under the Hood of dotNet Memory Management")](http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/1906434751/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1638&amp;creative=19454&amp;creativeASIN=1906434751&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=fabsenetfabse-21 "Under the Hood of .Net Memory Management on Amazon")But there was one exception lately. I don't want to sound too cocky, but most of the IT books bore me to death. I have to read 200 pages full of beginner stuff I already know to find this little tiny peace of knowledge, which is really new to me.

[Under the Hood of .Net Memory Management](http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/1906434751/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1638&amp;creative=19454&amp;creativeASIN=1906434751&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=fabsenetfabse-21 "Under the Hood of .Net Memory Management on Amazon") is a whole different story. I know memory management stuff from the operating system but this is different. The book is full of special knowledge around the insides of the .Net framework. It explains in detail the structure of the memory, how 'new' works, what the memory generations are and how the garbage collector works. Did you know that there is not only one garbage collector, but many? There are different implementations with different improvements in each framework release. Do you want to know, why a 'new' in C# is so much cheaper than in c++?

I really enjoyed reading every page of this book! So it is a natural step to recommend it to you, my dear reader. If you are interested in programming beyond hello world stuff, you really should read this book.
