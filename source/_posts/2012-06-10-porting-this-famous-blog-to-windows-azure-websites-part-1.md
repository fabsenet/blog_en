Viewing it myself, I decided to move my blog to an Azure Website to gain more experience with the platform. I used my Windows Live ID to register for the three month free trial. After this I noticed, I need to sign up for the new preview features. Unfortunately, there is some queuing in action. So I need to wait ![Sad smile](https://az275061.vo.msecnd.net/blogmedia/2012/06/wlEmoticon-sadsmile1.png)
