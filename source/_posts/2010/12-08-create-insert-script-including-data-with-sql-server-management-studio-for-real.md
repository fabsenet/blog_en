[After a co-worker of me had not been able to find the right option](http://stefanscheller.wordpress.com/2010/12/06/create-insert-script-including-data-with-sql-server-management-studio/) (but was able to help hisself anyway) I decided to share the trick:

Right click your database, select “Tasks”, then “Generate Scripts”:

Follow the wizzard, but change the option to script data to true:

You should be able to figure out everything else on your own.
