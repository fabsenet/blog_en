Today I installed Windows 8.1 Pro over my desktop PC running Windows 8 Pro. The first time, I did not had the option to “Keep Windows settings, personal files, and apps” but I thought “Keep personal files only” would do its best to keep everything else as well. I did a complete backup using Acronis True Image just to be save.

The setup took 10 minutes or so and I was greeted with a really empty 8.1 experience. At this point, it dawned on me! While I was on the “normal” upgrade path (8 Pro to 8.1 Pro), I had different languages! I was going from an English 8 to a German 8.1 and – as it turns out – in this case, you cannot keep your programs!

The recovery took like an hour and my Windows 8 Pro was back. I used the time to download the English 8.1 as well. The next setup experience was different. It took like 30 minutes but after that, it still looked like my PC with my programs and stuff but with a new start button ;-)

Summing up:

*   It was the first time, a backup really saved me from doing something stupid
*   Always select the right language and option
